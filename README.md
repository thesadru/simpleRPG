# basic

This is my very first python game, so don't expect any pretty or even understandable code.    
There are no visuals so just start it up in a console.    
â €    

The code should be able to tell, if you are playing in a console or not, but if you see a different window opening, just run the program again, and the problem should disappear.   
If the problem remains, you will have to type 'terminal' into the main screen.

If there's the opposite of this problem, and the game puts all the text on bottom of the screen, type 'console'    

# recommended settings

For best enjoyment, I recommend right-clicking on the top of the console and play with properties.   
recommended settings:   
text size - 14 | text font - consolas | width - 240 | height - 69 | window - maximized   
Anything else doesn't really matter.   

Also please read the tutorial in 'tutorial', there's everything.

# recommended game settings

I recommend reading the tutorial and starting with normal difficulty, once you understand the game a bit, play on hard.
All moves are just If statements, so this game can be mastered. Imagine the speedruns on this.

# other

Please tell me any glitches you find, I want to make this game good.
